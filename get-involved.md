## Funding the Project

Toronto Mesh consists of a collective of people and does not currently hold legal status as an organization, nor do we have a bank account. Workshops, conferences, and deployments are generally paid out-of-pocket by the people organizing that particular initiative or through grants.

Grant applications are applied for in partnership with non-profit organizations, and each application is agreed upon using [our general method of establishing consensus](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/coordination-structure.md#decision-making), either at meetings or virtually on [#governance:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#governance:tomesh.net). We keep [a listing of all grants and sources of institutional funding](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/governance/funding.md) that involve Toronto Mesh as a partner.

If you would like to contribute to the Toronto Mesh project as an organization, or have any questions regarding our finances, please email [funding@tomesh.net](mailto:funding@tomesh.net).
