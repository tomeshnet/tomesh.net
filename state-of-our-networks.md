Conceived in 1996, **TAO Collective**{:#tao}, or OAT ("Organizing Autonomous Telecomms"), is a Canada-based organization founded on anarchist principles of self-determination, cooperation, and liberty, values expressed by the empowerment of everyday activists in possessing non-corporate and non-state-controlled Internet tools. The scope of the project has changed over the years, once servicing radicals around the world and operating several geographical collectives, it now maintains resources for largely Toronto based activists and a small tech collective interested in security and activism.

We believe in building relationships and creating engagement through efforts that utilize research, co-creation, and empathy building to reach out to disengaged youth.
