Join us for a hands-on work session to play around with configuring long-range [Ubiquiti antennas](https://www.ubnt.com/airmax/litebeam-ac/), the [TP-Link wireless network adapter dongles](http://www.tp-link.com/us/download/TL-WN722N.html), and other hardware for ad-hoc and 802.11s mesh networking.

Our goal is to build local experience with various WiFi equipment for our network deployments, as well as to document findings to share with mesh locals outside of Toronto. [Existing reports can be found here](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/technical), and we welcome contributions of test results by Pull Requests, with location for the tests indicated in the post's [front matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).
