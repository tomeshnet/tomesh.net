Biweekly standing open-call for remote parties to sync up on topics of mutual interest. The hours are selected to make it possible for parties of different timezones to attend.

Anyone may propose a topic on [this open-edit pad](https://hackmd.io/HSOK15u7TnS6Oz1RH0McGg), taking one of six timeslots by putting yourself as _Facilitator_ and filling the corresponding [_Agenda_](https://hackmd.io/HSOK15u7TnS6Oz1RH0McGg#Agenda) section.

The _Course_ hour is for topics relating to the [Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet workshop series](https://tomeshnet.github.io/p2p-internet-workshop/), such as discussing about workshop facilitation at a new location, the logistics of getting the hardware and software set up, funding opportunities for curriculum development, etc.

The _General_ hour is for all other issues, such as [Prototype](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi) or [Mesh Orange](https://github.com/tomeshnet/mesh-orange) updates, IPFS live streaming discussions, showcasing your new project, or collective brainstorming of collaboration opportunities with Toronto Mesh.

Please scope your session within a 20 minute time block. If more time is needed, it is probably best to use the 20 minutes to give an overview then schedule separate meetings with interested parties. The hope is that these standing hours can be well attended and everyone participating gets a general idea of the things going on in different mesh communities.

Meeting notes for previous iterations are kept on [tomeshnet/documents/mesh_sync](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/tree/master/mesh_sync) ðŸ“¡
