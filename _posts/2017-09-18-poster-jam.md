Come to our {{ page.title }} to help us create posters and other outreach materials, update the overall look and feel, as well as prototype a new logo!

We will meet at Robarts Library on the **second floor** by the escalators at {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M %P"}}, access to the Semaphore lab is restricted so let us know if you are running late in [#design:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#design:tomesh.net).
