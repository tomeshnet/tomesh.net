- Re-evaluate our long-term goals.
- Set the priorities and projects to work on for the next six months.
- Assign **working group** leads for the next six months. You can see our current [working groups and governance processes here](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/coordination-structure.md)!
