Join us at our fifth planning session, where we regroup and plan for the winter! At this session we set priorities and projects and form **working groups** for the next six months and identify those interested in leading projects. You can see our [current working groups and governance processes](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/coordination-structure.md) to get a sense of existing interests!

We will break off to discuss ongoing deployment efforts afterwards.

We will meet at {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M %P "}} in Studio 307 (Room BL307), [140 St. George Street]({{ page.locationLink }}).  
The Claude T. Bissell building is an accessible space and this event has a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/).

All are welcome to join, just send an email to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) so we know you are coming!
