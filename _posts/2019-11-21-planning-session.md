This is Toronto Mesh's ninth planning session. We will regroup and plan for the winter and beyond! During this session we will:
- Review all projects and efforts undertaken since May.
- Set the priorities and projects to work on for the next six months.
- Assign working group leads for the next six months. You can see our current [working groups and governance processes here](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/coordination-structure.md)!

We will meet at {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M %P "}} in [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.locationLink }}).

Do you have any e-waste you would like to donate to Free Geek? Bring it! See their list of [accepted electronics here](https://www.freegeektoronto.org/pick-up/).

This event has a [code of conduct](/code-of-conduct/).
