Join us at our fourth planning session, where we regroup and plan for the summer! At this session we set priorities and projects and form form **working groups** for the next six months and identify those interested in leading projects. You can see our [current working groups and governance processes](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/coordination-structure.md) to get a sense of existing interests!

We will meet at {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M %P "}} in Studio 307 (Room BL307), [140 St. George Street]({{ page.locationLink }}).
