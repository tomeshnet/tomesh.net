This is a trial run of our upcoming [Building the Peer-to-Peer Internet](https://tomesh.net/peer-to-peer-internet/) workshop series at the Toronto Public Library. During the two-hour session, we will be running the first module of the series in a group setting for the first time. The goal is to try out the format and identify friction points in the workshop, in preparation for the official workshop series.

Everyone is welcome and no registration is required for this trial workshop, but resources are limited so please bring your laptop and a Raspberry Pi 2 or 3 if you have one. We hope you can join us at [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.locationLink }}), {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M%P "}} on {{ page.date | date: '%B %-d, %Y' }}.
