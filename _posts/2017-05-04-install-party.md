Join us at {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M%P "}} on {{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} for our monthly install party and play with distributed applications. This month we will be meeting at [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.locationLink }}) for a hands-on session before heading to a nearby bar for drinks and progress check with each working group.
