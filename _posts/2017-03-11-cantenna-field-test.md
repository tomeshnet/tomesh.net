We homemade a pair of cantennas and pigtail cables that connect to our [Raspberry Pi + TL-WN722N setups](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2). Let's meet on **March 11** at **9 am** on this bridge along Bathurst Street, 280 m away from a parallel bridge where we can place the other cantenna.

Hop onto [#hardware:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#hardware:tomesh.net) for pre-planning. It'll be a cold morning. It'll be great!

_Results of the field test are recapped in our [field test notes](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/technical/{{ page.date | date: "%Y%m%d" }}_cantenna-field-test.md)._
