Some Toronto Mesh members are connected through a virtual mesh network. This is a transitional phase where our mesh nodes are connected to one another using an internet connection instead of a physical line or radio. We are nonetheless able to test out distributed applications as if we are connected through a physical mesh.

Every other Thursday from **6:00 pm ET** on, we meet virtually on [#virtualmesh:tomesh.net](https://chat.tomesh.net/#/room/#virtualmesh:tomesh.net) and do some hands on hacking. This includes running services on our Raspberry Pi platform and testing distributed applications like [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). If you would like to join, just hop on our chat and say hi!

Although the [cjdns mesh software](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns) runs on multiple platforms, most people are [running it on a Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/tomeshnet/prototype-cjdns-pi2). No matter how you want to join, we will be happy to help you get meshed up.
