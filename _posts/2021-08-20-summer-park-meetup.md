Turns out it's hard to start a community network without being able to go out into the community... But now that it's the summer and we have a reasonably good rate of vaccination so perhaps it's time to start doing that again!

Join us for our first in-person meetup since the pandemic started!  We'll be outside at Christie Pits Park [around the picnic tables in between the pool and the playground](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6917209565).  This meetup is open to everybody so come on down, say hello, and talk to us about building a community network in Toronto!

New people are always welcome. Come say hi on our chat, or email us at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}), if you have any questions.  Otherwise see you on the 20th!
