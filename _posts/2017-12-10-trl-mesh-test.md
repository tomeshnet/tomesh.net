Join us at {{page.startTime | date:"%-I:%M%P "}} on {{ page.date | date: '%B %d, %Y' }} to help deploy and test the first at-scale Toronto Mesh network. Help us discover its capabilities, downfalls and maybe learn a thing or two you didn't know before! Our end goal with these tests is to learn enough to propose a Toronto Mesh deployment at 2018's Maker Festival which happens at the Toronto Reference Library in the summer. Meet us at [{{ page.location }}]({{ page.locationLink }}) and help out. Don't forget to bring your nodes, laptops, phones and other Internet capable devices!
