The Toronto Mesh Meshtastic project hopes to create an innovative communication network powered by the Meshtastic firmware and utilizing LoRa technology. This decentralized network enables communication over long distances without the need for a direct line of sight. By leveraging the low-power, wide-area capabilities of LoRa, the network provides coverage across Toronto.

The network operates at a slower data rate then WiFi. Users can exchange text messages, share GPS coordinates, and track device locations, or report sensor data within the Meshtastic mesh network. Whether it's for outdoor adventures, disaster response, or rural connectivity, the Toronto Mesh Meshtastic Network ensures reliable communication throughout the city without relying on traditional infrastructure.

By combining the benefits of Meshtastic firmware and LoRa technology, the network empowers individuals and communities to establish a resilient, low-cost communication network. Whether connecting in remote areas or bridging communication gaps in urban environments, the Toronto Mesh Meshtastic Network provides an affordable solution for long-range, non-line-of-sight communication needs.
