## Pledge

Toronto Mesh is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion or technical skill level.

In order to try and remove obstacles to participation, Toronto Mesh has adopted an explicitly-documented code to communicate our expectations for conduct within the community.

These are adapted from the anti-harassment policy from the [Geek Feminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Conference_anti-harassment/Policy) and draw inspiration from [No more rock stars: how to stop abuse in tech communities](https://hypatia.ca/2016/06/21/no-more-rock-stars/).

## Standards

We do not tolerate harassment of organization members and participants in any form. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, technical skill level
* sexual images in public spaces
* deliberate intimidation, stalking, following
* harassing photography or recording
* sustained disruption of talks or other events
* inappropriate physical contact
* unwelcome sexual attention
* advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any Toronto Mesh organization interactions, including in online spaces.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or asked to leave, at the discretion of the organizers.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces (both event and online spaces) and in public spaces when an individual is representing the Toronto Mesh project or its community.

## Enforcement

At events, Toronto Mesh organizers will identify themselves and any incidents can be reported to them directly. Event organizers will be happy to help participants by providing escorts, contacting local law enforcement, or otherwise assisting those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of an event. We value your participation.

In online spaces, Toronto Mesh moderators and administrators have elevated privileges in order to enforce our standards and Code of Conduct pledge.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from events and online forums.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Toronto Mesh moderator or organizer immediately.

Those who wish to report a violation but don't feel comfortable talking to the organizers online or at an event can email [coc@tomesh.net](mailto:coc@tomesh.net), which is **currently** monitored by [**Benedict**](https://twitter.com/LauBenedict) and [**Hank**](https://github.com/Shrinks99), and will be monitored by two people on a rotating basis.

Our [internal guidelines](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/governance/conduct-guidelines.md) for enforcing our Code of Conduct are viewable online.
