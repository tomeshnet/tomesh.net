We field test Ubiquiti LiteBeam ac directional antennas at [Tommy Thompson park](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/189780702#map=13/43.6328/-79.3324) in order to determine the feasibility of using them for Toronto Mesh links and [record our findings](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/meeting_notes/20161015_gigabit-link-field-test.md).
