We field tested Ubiquiti LiteBeam ac directional antennas at [Tommy Thompson park](http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/189780702#map=13/43.6328/-79.3324), in order to determine the feasibility of using them for multi-kilometre mesh links, and [recorded our findings](https://github.com/tomeshnet/documents/blob/master/technical/20161015_gigabit-link-field-test.md).
